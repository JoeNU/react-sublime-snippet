# React Sublime Snippets

Feeling bored with typing or even copying React codes to write React components and test cases? If you use Sublime, hope these code snippets can help you enjoy writing your React components.

The snippets follow JavaScript ES6 syntax, we don't use the old `React.createClass({...})` anymore, we write class component and functional component. Also we provide snippets to quickly write React Lifecycle functions (e.g. `componentDidMount`).
